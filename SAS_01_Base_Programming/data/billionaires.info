Overview
Researchers have compiled a multi-decade database of the super-rich.
Building off the Forbes Worldâ€™s Billionaires lists from 1996-2014, scholars at 
Peterson Institute for International Economics have added a couple dozen more 
variables about each billionaire - including whether they were self-made or 
inherited their wealth. 
(Roughly half of European billionaires and one-third of U.S. billionaires 
got a significant financial boost from family, the authors estimate.)
